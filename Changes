        - manifest.json is now properly decoded while being read, so
          UTF-8 strings in the manifest.json are treated the same way as
          \u.... sequences.  If you had been doubly-UTF-8-encoding your
          manifest.json to work around this bug, your code is now broken
          because my code is now fixed.

3.000002  2015-02-19 11:02:14-05:00 America/New_York
        - immutabilize more classes

3.000001  2014-12-01 14:10:12-05:00 America/New_York
          [BREAKING CHANGES]
        - content read from disk (templates, for example) is now decoded
          as UTF-8 if and only if the content type for which it is being used
          is text/*
        - for more information on this change, consult the "ENCODING" section
          of the documentation for Email::MIME::Kit

          [BUG FIXES]
        - non-text parts are no longer padded with CRLFs

2.102012  2013-04-08 15:29:38 America/New_York
